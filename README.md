# Hi, there üëã

I'm Pablo ‚Äî a Texas native with a love for punk rock, cooking, and all things web development. As a lifelong learner, I've found a real passion for building on the web, and I'm constantly expanding my skill set with new tools, frameworks, and even math.

When I‚Äôm not coding, you‚Äôll probably find me jamming on my guitar or spending time with friends. I love creating, problem-solving, and learning something new every day.

Currently learning:

Statistics  |  Discrete Math  |  TypeScript  |  Docker

Currently Earning my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at University of the People

Let‚Äôs build something cool.
