### Hi, there ðŸ‘‹

I am Juan from Texas, but you can call me Pablo. I am a life-long learner at heart with a background in real estate. However, my path has now led me to the exhilarating world of web development. I enjoy the challenges web development offers and relish the opportunities it offers for creative expression. 

I am excited to further develop my skills, one line at a time.
